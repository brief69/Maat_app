# gdv_front(Goal Direct Vote)

'Maat_Dimen'

## Overview

GDV is a unique social funding platform grounded in the principles of democracy. It allows users to post their goals or dreams with the ease of a social networking service (SNS), while other community members support these aspirations by voting with their wallets, much like 'liking' or replying to a post on SNS. This system is designed to ensure that funding is directly tied to the achievement of goals, thereby unlocking the hidden potential of various aspirations around the globe.
